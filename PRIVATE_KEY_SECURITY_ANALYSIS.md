# HeartWallet Private Key Security Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the security of private key handling in the HeartWallet Chrome extension. The analysis covers key storage, encryption, memory management, and potential exposure risks.

## Key Security Findings

### 1. Private Key Storage and Encryption

#### Secure Practices Identified:
- **Encrypted Storage**: Private keys are encrypted using ethers.js `wallet.encrypt()` before storage
- **Chrome Storage API**: Uses `chrome.storage.local` instead of localStorage for better security
- **Password-based Encryption**: Keys are encrypted with user passwords before storage

#### Code Evidence:
```javascript
// wallet-core.js - Line 56
const encryptedJson = await newWallet.encrypt(password);

// wallet-core.js - Line 77
await this.storage.set({ [walletId]: encryptedJson });
```

### 2. Memory Management

#### Current Implementation:
- **Ephemeral Key Storage**: Decrypted keys are stored temporarily in memory during active sessions
- **Basic Cleanup**: Attempts to overwrite keys with null characters before nullifying

#### Code Evidence:
```javascript
// background.js - Lines 299-301
ephemeralDecryptedKey = ''.padStart(ephemeralDecryptedKey.length, '\0');
ephemeralDecryptedKey = null;
```

#### Security Concerns:
- JavaScript's garbage collection doesn't guarantee immediate memory clearing
- String immutability in JavaScript means overwriting may not be effective
- No use of secure memory allocation techniques

### 3. Console Logging Analysis

#### Potential Exposure Points Found:

1. **Wallet Creation Logging**:
   ```javascript
   // wallet-core.js - Line 54
   console.log("addWallet: ethers.Wallet object created, address:", newWallet.address);
   ```
   - Logs wallet address but NOT private key ✓

2. **Background Script Logging**:
   ```javascript
   // background.js - Line 1146
   console.log("Ephemeral decrypted key stored in background memory.");
   ```
   - Confirms key storage but doesn't log the actual key ✓

3. **No Direct Private Key Logging**: 
   - No instances found where actual private key values are logged
   - All sensitive data logging appears to be descriptive rather than exposing values

### 4. Private Key Access Points

#### Export Functionality:
- Private key export requires password verification
- Export is handled through secure modal with copy functionality
- Warning messages displayed to users

#### Code Evidence:
```javascript
// settings.js - Lines 207-233
async function exportPrivateKey(walletId, walletAddress) {
    // Password verification required
    const password = prompt('Please enter your wallet password...');
    // ...
    const privateKey = await walletCore.exportPrivateKey(walletId, password);
}
```

### 5. Session Management

#### Security Features:
- Automatic session timeout (default 5 minutes)
- Session state cleared on timeout
- Keys removed from memory on logout

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Session timeout could be more aggressive for high-security environments
- No detection of inactive tabs or background state

### 6. Potential Vulnerabilities

#### Critical Issues:
1. **Memory Persistence**: JavaScript doesn't guarantee secure memory erasure
2. **Debug Files**: Debug utilities exist that could potentially expose sensitive data
3. **No Key Derivation**: Direct storage of private keys rather than derived keys

#### Medium Risk Issues:
1. **Console Logging**: While keys aren't logged, extensive logging could aid attackers
2. **Error Handling**: Some error messages might reveal system state
3. **Clipboard Access**: Private key export uses clipboard which could be monitored

### 7. Security Recommendations

#### High Priority:
1. **Implement Secure Memory Handling**:
   - Use WebCrypto API for key operations when possible
   - Consider using ArrayBuffer/Uint8Array for key storage
   - Implement proper zeroing of memory buffers

2. **Reduce Console Logging**:
   - Remove or reduce console.log statements in production
   - Implement debug mode flag for development

3. **Enhanced Key Protection**:
   - Consider using key derivation (PBKDF2) for storage
   - Implement hardware wallet support for key isolation

#### Medium Priority:
1. **Session Security**:
   - Detect and clear sessions on browser minimize/background
   - Implement re-authentication for sensitive operations

2. **Audit Trail**:
   - Log security events without exposing sensitive data
   - Implement tamper detection

3. **Code Obfuscation**:
   - Minify and obfuscate production code
   - Remove debug utilities from production builds

## Conclusion

The HeartWallet extension implements basic security practices for private key handling, including encryption at rest and password protection. However, there are opportunities for improvement in memory management, session handling, and reducing potential attack surfaces through better logging practices and code hardening.

The most critical concern is the reliance on JavaScript's memory management, which cannot guarantee secure erasure of sensitive data. Implementing additional layers of security and following the recommendations above would significantly improve the overall security posture of the extension.

## Compliance Notes

- The extension should clearly document its security model for users
- Regular security audits should be performed
- Consider implementing bug bounty program for security researchers
