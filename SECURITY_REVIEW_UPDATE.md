# Security Review Update - Heart Wallet

## Initial Security Concerns vs Current Status

### 1. ❌ Private Key Storage in Memory (CRITICAL - NOT FIXED)
**Initial Concern**: The wallet stores the decrypted private key in `ephemeralDecryptedKey` variable in background.js memory for the entire session duration.

**Current Status**: **STILL VULNERABLE**
- Private key remains in plaintext in background script memory
- Exposed to memory dumps, debugger access, and malicious extensions
- Session timeout helps but doesn't eliminate the risk

**Recommendation**: Implement message-based decryption where the key is only decrypted for each transaction/signature and immediately cleared.

### 2. ✅ Transaction Visibility (FIXED)
**Initial Concern**: Users might sign transactions without understanding what they're approving.

**Current Status**: **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED**
- Added human-readable transaction decoding
- Shows token names, amounts, and recipients
- Special warnings for unlimited token approvals
- Clear display of gas costs and totals

### 3. ⚠️ Content Script Injection (PARTIALLY ADDRESSED)
**Initial Concern**: Content script injected into all web pages could be exploited.

**Current Status**: **PARTIALLY IMPROVED**
- Still injects into all pages (`<all_urls>`)
- But uses secure message passing
- Origin validation is implemented
- Connected sites management added

**Remaining Risk**: Broad injection surface area could still be reduced.

### 4. ✅ Secure Communication (PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Initial Concern**: Message passing between components needs proper validation.

**Current Status**: **GOOD**
- Origin validation implemented
- Request IDs for tracking
- Proper async response handling
- Type checking on messages

### 5. ⚠️ Input Validation (PARTIALLY ADDRESSED)
**Initial Concern**: User inputs need thorough validation.

**Current Status**: **IMPROVED BUT INCOMPLETE**
- Address validation using ethers.js
- Transaction parameter validation added
- Some inputs still lack comprehensive validation (e.g., token decimals)

### 6. ✅ Session Management (IMPROVED)
**Initial Concern**: No session timeout originally.

**Current Status**: **IMPLEMENTED**
- Configurable session timeout (5-30 minutes)
- Auto-logout on inactivity
- Session state properly managed

### 7. ❌ CSP Headers (NOT FULLY ADDRESSED)
**Initial Concern**: Content Security Policy could be stricter.

**Current Status**: **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**
```json
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src https:; object-src 'self'; font-src 'self';"
}
```
- Still allows broad `https:` connections
- Could be more restrictive

### 8. ✅ Password Encryption (PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED)
**Initial Concern**: Wallet encryption implementation.

**Current Status**: **GOOD**
- Uses ethers.js encryption (AES-256-CTR)
- Proper password-based encryption
- No plaintext storage of wallets

### 9. ✅ Permissions (APPROPRIATE)
**Initial Concern**: Extension permissions review.

**Current Status**: **MINIMAL AND APPROPRIATE**
- Only requests `storage` permission
- No unnecessary permissions
- Appropriate for wallet functionality

### 10. ❌ Error Handling (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)
**Initial Concern**: Sensitive information in error messages.

**Current Status**: **STILL RISKY**
- Some error messages still expose technical details
- Stack traces could leak information
- Needs sanitization layer

## New Security Features Added:

### ✅ Connected Sites Management
- Tracks which sites have permission to see wallet address
- User can disconnect sites
- Prevents unauthorized access

### ✅ Transaction Decoding
- Decodes ERC-20 operations
- Shows human-readable details
- Warns about risky operations

### ✅ Origin Validation
- Validates requesting site origin
- Shows origin in all confirmation popups
- Prevents spoofing attacks

## Overall Security Score: 6.5/10

### Critical Issues Remaining:
1. **Private key in memory** - Highest risk
2. **Broad content script injection** - Attack surface
3. **Error message leakage** - Information disclosure

### Improvements Made:
1. **Transaction transparency** - Major UX security win
2. **Session management** - Reduces exposure window
3. **Connected sites tracking** - Better access control

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **PRIORITY 1**: Implement secure key handling
   - Never store decrypted key in background
   - Decrypt only when needed
   - Clear immediately after use

2. **PRIORITY 2**: Restrict content script injection
   - Only inject on user action
   - Or limit to specific domains

3. **PRIORITY 3**: Implement error sanitization
   - Generic user-facing errors
   - Detailed logs only in dev mode

4. **PRIORITY 4**: Add additional security features
   - Transaction simulation
   - Address book with labels
   - Phishing detection
