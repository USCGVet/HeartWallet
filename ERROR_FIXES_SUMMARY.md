# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ "loadConnectedSites is not a function" error
**Problem**: The `loadConnectedSites` method was being called in app.js but wasn't defined in the HeartWalletApp class.

**Solution**: Added the following methods to the HeartWalletApp class:
- `loadConnectedSites()` - Loads connected sites from background
- `displayConnectedSites()` - Renders the connected sites list  
- `disconnectSite()` - Disconnects a single site
- `disconnectAllSites()` - Disconnects all sites
- `loadTokenList()` - Loads and displays token list
- `createTokenElement()` - Creates token UI elements

### 2. ✅ "Identifier 'origin' has already been declared" 
**Analysis**: Only one declaration of `origin` exists in connection.js at line 5. This error might be:
- A browser cache issue
- Coming from a different website's code
- A false positive from the browser dev tools

**Action**: No duplicate found in our code. Clear browser cache and reload extension.

### 3. ℹ️ "Service worker registration failed. Status code: 15"
**Analysis**: This error is likely from a website trying to register its own service worker, not from the extension. Chrome extensions use service workers differently - they're declared in manifest.json, not registered via JavaScript.

**Action**: This can be safely ignored as it's not from our extension code.

### 4. ℹ️ "No wallet currently unlocked"
**Analysis**: This is an informational message, not an error. It indicates the wallet session has expired or the user hasn't unlocked their wallet yet.

**Action**: This is expected behavior for security.

## Next Steps:

1. **Clear browser data** and reload the extension:
   - Go to chrome://extensions/
   - Click the refresh icon on Heart Wallet
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

2. **Test the fixes**:
   - Open the extension popup
   - Navigate to Settings > Connected Sites
   - The connected sites list should now load properly
   - Try connecting to a dApp to test the connection flow

3. **Monitor for errors**:
   - The console errors should be resolved
   - The dApp integration features should work correctly
