3. If creating:
   - Write down your 12-word seed phrase (NEVER share this!)
   - Create a strong password (20+ characters recommended)
   - Verify 3 random words from your seed phrase
   - Check the confirmation box
   - Click "CREATE WALLET"
4. If importing:
   - Enter your 12-word seed phrase or private key
   - Create a password to encrypt the wallet
   - Click "IMPORT WALLET"
5. If adding Ledger:
   - Make sure your Ledger device is connected and unlocked
   - Open the Ethereum app on your Ledger
   - Select your Ledger from the browser's device picker
   - Choose which address(es) to import
   - No password needed - your Ledger handles all signing!

### Unlocking Your Wallet

- Enter your password
- Click "UNLOCK"
- Wallet auto-locks after configured inactivity period

### Sending Transactions

1. Click "Send" on the dashboard
2. Enter recipient address
3. Enter amount (or click "Send Max" to send all available balance minus gas)
4. Choose gas speed (Slow/Normal/Fast/Custom)
5. Review transaction details
6. Confirm with password (or approve on Ledger device for hardware wallets)

### Managing Transactions

**Pending transactions can be:**
- **Sped Up** - Increase gas price to confirm faster
- **Cancelled** - Replace with 0-value transaction to yourself

Both options show live network gas prices to help you make informed decisions.

### Hardware Wallet Support

HeartWallet supports **Ledger Nano S, Ledger Nano X, and Ledger Nano S Plus** via WebHID.

**Features:**
- 🔐 **Maximum security** - Private keys never leave your Ledger device

## Philosophy

HeartWallet is built on the principle that **trust is personal**.

There's no such thing as "trustless" - you either trust the developer who wrote the code, the maintainer who curates the token list, or the people running the infrastructure. HeartWallet is maintained by a trusted PulseChain community member who values integrity and transparency above all else.

We don't gatekeep networks. We don't track users. We don't inject ads. We just build a wallet that works.
